        <li>75 g light brown sugar</li>
        <li>75 g golden caster sugar</li>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Preheat oven</strong>: Set to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment.</li>
        <li> <strong> Cream </strong>: Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
        <li> <strong> Portion</strong>: Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li> <strong> Cook</strong>:  Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool.</li>
        <li> <strong> Cool</strong>: Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li> <strong> Enjoy</strong>: Eat while still warm or enjoy them anytime in the next three days, store in an airtight container.</li>
