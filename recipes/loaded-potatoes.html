    <p>A fun and easy appetizer or side dish to prepare for the next you have friend and family over, or maybe just as your own treat!</p>

Potatoes will pair with basically anything and act as a canvas for you to put your own style and inspirations on.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium to large Russet potateos - a non-waxy potato works best!</li>
        <li>200 g shredded cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>6 slices of bacon, cooked and diced</li>
        <li>8 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Spring onions, chopped, for topping.</li>
        <li>Seasoning, salt and ground black pepper, to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
<ol>
   <li> <strong>Bake Potatoes</strong>: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Poke potatoes with a fork, place on a baking sheet and cook for 1 hour. Remove from the baking sheet, and allow to cool for about 15 minutes or until cool enough to handle. </li>
   <li> <strong>Cut Potatoes</strong>: Cut each potato lengthwise to create two halves.</li>
   <li> <strong>Hollow out</strong>: Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh from the halved potatoes into a separate bowl, leave behind enough flesh to keep the structure of the potato.</li>
   <li> <strong>Mix fillings</strong>: Add the majority of your cheese and bacon to the flesh you've scooped out and mix them together. Leave some behind for garnish if you desire.</li>
   <li> <strong>Season</strong>: Turn on your oven's broiler to high heat. Brush your hollowed out halves with olive oil and season them to taste.</li>
   <li> <strong>Broil</strong>: Put your hollowed and seasoned skins under the broiler for 5-6 minutes until they get crispy on the inside. You may wish to flip them over to crisp up the bottoms too.</li>
   <li> <strong>Fill</strong>: Take out the skins and load them with your mixed fillings from step 4. Garnish with any left over toppings. </li>
   <li> <strong>Broil</strong>: Place back under the broiler for another 4-5 minutes for the cheese to go crispy and the filling to be warmed through.</li>
   <li> <strong>Serve</strong>: Remove from the oven and serve warm as a starter or a filling side dish to accompany your main.</li>
