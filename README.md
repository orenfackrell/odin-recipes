# odin-recipes
This is my fifth day on my path to learning code through The Odin Project and now I'm working on the recipes project.
The task is to create a home page which will contain links to three other pages - on those pages will be three separate recipes including (in order) an 'h1' title;  an image of the dish; a description of this image; an ingredients heading followed by an unordered list of said ingredients; and finally add a steps heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.

Before beginning this project, I will endeavour to avoid using excessive shortcuts like "!" to get the in the repetitions of creating the boilerplate. 
Being my first project I am most worried about the rate at which I commit and the quality of my commit messages - for example right now I'm wondering if I need to commit things like changes to this "README.md" file, my plan is to start committing frequently and then be corrected on that in the future. 
Better to give too much information than not enough right?


After completing the project I'm feeling very accomplished, after checking the solutions at the bottom of the odin project page (I didn't notice that was there before) my pages look very similar. One feature I noticed and implemented that I hadn't done by myself was linking the recipe pages back to the home page. Another feature I saw and didn't implement was the "return to top" link to go back to the top headed. This was done in Jason-B-Jiang's solution by giving an id of 'header' to his 'h1' heading and then using that id as the href value in the 'return to top anchor'. I have added this feature to my own documents I am making learning notes on, but did not use it in any of my pages for the project because none of the pages are long enough. 

I feel more assured of my commit rate, just concerned that my commit messages were too generalized as you need to go into the commit to see the affected file. Maybe I could make it easier to follow by including the affected file in the commit comment somehow? 

If anyone is reading some helpful comments will be read and lessons taken on board and massively appreciated. Really happy with the progress I've made in the four days I've been doing the Odin Project :).
