# odin-recipes
This is my fifth day on my path to learning code through The Odin Project and now I'm working on the recipes project.
The task is to create a home page which will contain links to three other pages - on those pages will be three separate recipes including (in order) an 'h1' title;  an image of the dish; a description of this image; an ingredients heading followed by an unordered list of said ingredients; and finally add a steps heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.

Before beginning this project, I will endeavour to avoid using excessive shortcuts like "!" to get the in the repetitions of creating the boilerplate. 
Being my first project I am most worried about the rate at which I commit and the quality of my commit messages - for example right now I'm wondering if I need to commit things like changes to this "README.md" file, my plan is to start committing frequently and then be corrected on that in the future. 
Better to give too much information than not enough right?
